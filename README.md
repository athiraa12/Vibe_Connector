Ever since the pandemic the social skills of every single teenager has hit rock bottom. Finding new friends is extremely hard. And almost everyone has become a professional introvert. Simply walking up to anyone and asking their interests, like we used to pre-covid, now leaves us shaking in our boots. Added to this it is recently everyone’s worst nightmare when someone they never talked to before starts to talking to them.
So in order to help teens socialize better this program comes in handy to find people with matching interests. So they would now know what topics to use to strike up a conversation. And surround themselves with people of similar tastes and personality.


# Teen Socializer - Connecting Teens with Shared Interests

This project was created to help teenagers improve their social skills, which have taken a hit since the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding new friends has become increasingly difficult, and many teens have become more introverted than ever before. This program aims to bridge that gap by matching people with shared interests, making it easier to strike up conversations and form meaningful connections.
